# cCode
C and C++ OOP programs created by myself in 2012 for OOP course.
Most of the C and C++ programs within this repository are organized in a directory with three files.

# Organization
There is a header file that contains the class, a C or Cpp file that contains the methods used, and lastly
a C or Cpp file that contians the "main" or driver of the program.

# Needing updated
Unfortunately there is minimal commenting in these programs, I will update this ASAP.

# Running
A standard makefile can be used to compile these programs (not included).  Used GNU compiler.

# Testing
No tests are added to this rep0.
